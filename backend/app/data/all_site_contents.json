However, because no persistent copy of your email or calendar content was stored on our servers in the first place, there is no data to delete in this scenario.\n \nDisconnecting these services simply revokes the authorization for our platform to make those real-time requests to Google on your behalf.\n \n \nKnowledge Connections, such as those for Google Drive or Microsoft Sharepoint, involve indexing the content of your selected files and folders and storing this indexed data on our servers to enable real-time search and retrieval by le Chat.

However, the indexed data on our servers is NOT deleted by this action, as the organizational connection and index might still be active for other users. \n•  Organization Admin Disconnect (via Admin Controls): If an Organization Administrator disables or disconnects a Knowledge Connection from the Admin Controls panel, this action has broader consequences and initiates data deletion. \n \nIndividual User Disconnect: If an individual user disconnects a Knowledge Connection via their My Connections page, they lose access to use that connection within le Chat.

    "Will my drives data permissions be replicated into your system? (ACLs permissions)\n\n\nWhen you use Knowledge Connections (like Google Drive or Microsoft Sharepoint) to index your organization's content for use with le Chat, a primary concern is ensuring that existing access controls and permissions are respected.\n \n \nOur platform is designed to mirror the user, group, and permission structures from your connected applications. We utilize Access-Control List (ACL) permissions from the source system (e.g., Google Drive, Sharepoint) to replicate the correct access rights for the appropriate users within le Chat.\n \n🔑 This means that if a user does not have permission to access a specific file or folder in the original application (like Google Drive or Sharepoint), they will not be able to access that content through le Chat either. Your data remains safely scoped according to its original permissions.\n \nWhen a user queries le Chat using a Knowledge Connection, the system checks their entitlements against the indexed ACLs before retrieving or presenting any information.\n \n \nWhile the core principle of ACL mirroring applies broadly, there are some service-specific considerations, intended to make permissions still more secure:\n \n\nMicrosoft Azure / Sharepoint\n \n• Group Membership: For Sharepoint access, we primarily rely on Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) group memberships to determine permissions. Legacy Sharepoint site groups that are not backed by Entra ID groups may not be fully recognized for permission scoping.\n• Guest Access: Files or sites shared exclusively with external guest users in Sharepoint are generally not indexed or made accessible through the Knowledge Connection for regular internal users.\nGroup Membership: For Sharepoint access, we primarily rely on Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) group memberships to determine permissions.

    "How do Mistral Code suggestions integrate with version control tools such as Git?\n\n\nMistral Code is designed to assist you in writing and modifying code, and these changes can be seamlessly integrated into your existing version control workflows, such as those using Git.\n \n \nCode suggested or generated by Mistral Code becomes part of your project files as long as you accept the suggestions and save your files.\n \n\n1. Direct code completion\n \nWhen Mistral Code provides code completion suggestions as you type, accepting these suggestions (e.g., by pressing Tab or a specific accept key) directly inserts the suggested code into your active file.\n \n🔑 These suggestions are not staged or committed by default until you explicitly do so using your IDE's or Git's tools.\n \n\n2. Code generation via the chat interface\n \nWhen you use the Mistral Code chat panel to request code generation (e.g., \"write a Python function to sort a list\"), the AI will provide the code directly within the chat.\n \nYou can then typically use buttons like Apply to file, Insert at cursor, or a simple copy/paste action to transfer this generated code into your desired file and location.\n \n🔑 Once the code from Mistral Code is incorporated into your files, it becomes just like any other code you've written manually and can be staged and committed using your usual Git commands (e.g., git add and git commit)\n \n \nAdditionaly, Mistral Code offers the /commit command that you may use directly within the Chat interface, both in VS Code and JetBrains IDEs extensions.\n \n🔑 This command can generate a ready-to-use commit message based on your currently staged changes, helping you write clear and consistent commit messages more quickly.\n• \n• ",
    "How does Mistral Code handle multi-file projects and context?\n\n\nWhen working on larger software projects, code is typically spread across multiple files and directories.\n \n🔑 Mistral Code is designed to handle these multi-file projects effectively but, like any AI tool, you need to provide it with adequate context and some guidance to understand the structure of your project.\n \n \nMistral Code autocompletion (typically triggered by pressing the tab key) provides blazingly fast contextually relevant suggestions based on the current file and its surroundings, at the trade-off of not inherently understanding the broader project structure or the relationships between different files.\n \nTo the contrary, Mistral Code's chat interface is designed to understand and leverage the broader context of your project, using special conversation commands to help it focus on specific files, directories, or aspects of your codebase.\n \n \nAdding context to your Chat conversations is as simple as hitting the @ symbol on your keyboard then using one of the following context commands:\n \n• @Current File: Instructs Mistral Code to focus its attention primarily on the content of the currently active file in your editor.\n• @Open Files: Adds all files that are currently open in your IDE tabs to the conversation's context (⚠️ warning: this can lead to large token usage in your prompts, which can slow down Mistral Code's responses).\n• @Files: Allows you to browse and select specific files or directories from your project to be explicitly included in the context. (You might also be able to directly reference a file using a syntax like @FileName.extension for quick single-file selection)\n• @Git Diff: Adds the current changes in your codebase (the difference between your working directory and the last Git commit) to the context. Useful for asking questions about recent modifications or generating commit messages.\n• @Terminal: Allows you to reference the content or output of your IDE's integrated terminal, such as the last command run or its output, making it part of the context for Mistral Code.\n• @Problems: Brings any problems or errors detected by your IDE (e.g., linting errors, compilation errors) in your current file or project into the context, allowing you to ask Mistral Code for help in resolving them.\n@Current File: Instructs Mistral Code to focus its attention primarily on the content of the currently active file in your editor.\n@Open Files: Adds all files that are currently open in your IDE tabs to the conversation's context (⚠️ warning: this can lead to large token usage in your prompts, which can slow down Mistral Code's responses).\n@Files: Allows you to browse and select specific files or directories from your project to be explicitly included in the context.
